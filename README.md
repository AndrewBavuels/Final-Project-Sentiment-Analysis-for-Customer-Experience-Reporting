## **3. Minimal Functional App ⚙️**

To know the purpose of our visualization, **first** we must know the audience we will present it to, in order to prepare our visualization and give the right message with the right words.

<!-- For this case, I developed a fictional character for the **Profile Persona** named Lucia, which the visualization will allow her to **take decisions about** what skills should be trained for **and** what countries offers the best for her professional development. -->
