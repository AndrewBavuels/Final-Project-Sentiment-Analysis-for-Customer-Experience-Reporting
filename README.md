# **Final Project - Sentiment Analysis for Customer Experience Reporting 📈📲🎵**

The goal for this project was to apply advanced natural language processing techniques to **analyze customer reviews** and then, identify **areas for improvement** in the user experience.

*"**Fun Fact:** This project idea popped out while I was reviewing LinkedIn Jobs. One of them roles got my attention, regarding customer experience improvement and teamwork, to test new features for an App."*

## 1. Project description 👇
> Final Project - Part-time Sept 2023 - [Ironhack Madrid - Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/es-en/data-analytics):

### **_Development of KPI Dashboards and Reporting System, using Python, Pandas, and NLP tools._**

For this project I used a "Spotify App Reviews" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaaris/spotify-app-reviews-2022). After being processed, the output was explored and saved in Tableau Public.


### Problems detected to solve are as follows:

- Complex issues and gaps that affect customer experience
- There is no assigned role structure for the identified problems
- No reporting system to communicate issues effectively to stakeholders
- Insufficient capacity to reply customer/user reviews


### Functional architecture design:
