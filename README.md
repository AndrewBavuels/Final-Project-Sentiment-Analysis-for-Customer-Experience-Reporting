# **Final Project - Sentiment Analysis for Customer Experience Reporting üìàüì≤üéµ**

The goal for this project was to apply advanced natural language processing techniques to **analyze customer reviews** and then, identify **areas for improvement** in the user experience.

*"**Fun Fact:** This project idea popped out while I was reviewing LinkedIn Jobs. One of them roles got my attention, regarding customer experience improvement and teamwork, to test new features for an App."*

For this project I used a "Spotify App Reviews (apparently on Google Play Store)" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaaris/spotify-app-reviews-2022). After being processed, the output was explored and saved in Tableau Public.
