# **Final Project - Sentiment Analysis for Customer Experience Reporting 📈📲🎵**

The goal for this project was to apply advanced natural language processing techniques to **analyze customer reviews** and then, identify **areas for improvement** in the user experience.

*"**Fun Fact:** This project idea popped out while I was reviewing LinkedIn Jobs. One of them roles got my attention, regarding customer experience improvement and teamwork, to test new features for an App."*

## 1. Project description 👇
> Final Project - Part-time Sept 2023 - [Ironhack Madrid - Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/es-en/data-analytics):
> 
### **_Development of KPI Dashboards and Reporting System, using Python, Pandas, and NLP tools._**

For this project I used a "Spotify App Reviews" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaaris/spotify-app-reviews-2022). After being processed, the output was explored and saved in Tableau Public.


### Problems detected to solve are as follows:

- Complex issues and gaps that affect customer experience
- There is no assigned role structure for the identified problems
- No reporting system to communicate issues effectively to stakeholders
- Insufficient capacity to reply customer/user reviews


### Functional architecture design:

## **2. Technology stack 💻**

### Programming language:
- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)


### Python Libraries:
- [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html): For data visualization.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/): For mathematical operations and array manipulation.
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html): For data manipulation and analysis.
- [nltk](https://nltk.org/): For sentiment analysis among natural language processing tasks.

## **3. Minimal Functional App ⚙️**

### Technical Requirements ⚙
- Construct a Tableau Story consisting of at least 5 story points for the data set we have chosen.
- Use Story features such as captions and annotations.
- Use all the concepts we covered in the chapter (sorting, filtering, different visualizations types, aggregations, etc.).
- Our Tableau workbook consisting of at least 5 visualizations and 1 Story should be saved to Tableau Public.
- Create a Github repo for this project, and our data should be saved to that repo in a folder named data.
- Include a README.md file that describes the steps we took, our thought process as you built your visualizations and Story in Tableau, and a link to - our workbook on Tableau Public.

### Deliverables

- A Tableau workbook uploaded to Tableau Public that contains the visualizations and Story you created from your data set.
- A data folder containing the data set you used for our project.
- A README.md file containing a detailed explanation of your approach and code for constructing visualizations and organizing them into a Story as well as our results, obstacles encountered, lessons learned, and a link to our completed Tableau workbook.


### Dashboards:

#### - Issues Management: Dashboard from Negative Reviews

#### - Satisfaction Management: Dashboard from Positive Reviews

> *"I named this dashboard Spotiliebers (a parody term from Justin Bieber Fans) referring to Spotify Users Support, in order to give a fresh touch to this project".*
